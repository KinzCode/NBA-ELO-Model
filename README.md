## **General**
This repository holds the codebase for an ELO model applied to the National Basketball Association(NBA). This is a predictive model that can be made by someone with no to very little knowledge of more advanced statistical/ machine learning modelling practices. Further, it is essential to note that the predictions generated by this model **must not be used for gambling purposes**. Market setters of NBA odds use more advanced modelling techniques that capture more variance of the game, which this basic technique does. Anyone who fails to adhere to this advice does so at their own risk.

ELO is calculated by
